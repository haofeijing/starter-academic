  * Adapted a deep neural network to approximate value function in a
  discrete optimal stopping problem and applied the method to Bermudan option
  pricing

  * Compared the simulated results to a theoretical computation from
  Black-Scholes Model for European option pricing to verify correctness

  * Replicated a published paper’s simulation; analyzed the convergence and
  performance of neural network; found the previous work’s limitations: too
  strong assumption and huge sample complexity

  * Created a mathematical model using dynamic programming for the optimal
  stock selling/buying decision in the bull/bear switching market and find each
  single decision through deep optimal stopping (DOS)
