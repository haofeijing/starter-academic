  * Adapted deep reinforcement learning to find the optimal consecutive
  batch-match time interval for online ride hailing platforms

  * Replicated the results of a paper published by Didi Chuxing; verify the
  correctness and analyzed the performance of previous method

  * Created a traffic network using Python and generated passenger-driver data
  through a mixed Gaussian model. Organized a simulation to verify the
  feasibility of our method
