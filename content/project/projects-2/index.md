  * Studied an aircraft switching problem: given two stochastic processes and
  two servers, based on current observation of arrival, decided whether to
  switch two servers to accommodate unexpected demand

  * Focused on whether to switch, when to switch, and benefit of the switch

  * Proved the existence of a threshold: the switch must be made if the arrival is large enough

  * Established the monotonicity of the parameters such as time, arrival rate, and server capacity

  * Proved the order of benefit of switching flexibility in time $ T $
